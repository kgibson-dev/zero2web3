                    <p class="article-current-content">After several months of learning in the 
                        Frontend Developer Career Path at Scrimba, I've made the jump
                        to learning the exciting new world of Web 3.0 development

                    <p class="article-current-subtitle">How I stay committed to learning </p>
                    <p class="article-current-content">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
                        then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects. 
                        
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most 
                        things about my journey with the world. </p>   
                        
                    <p class="article-current-subtitle">How I got started </p>
                        
                    <p class="article-current-content">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. 
                            After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short 
                            summaries of what I learned using my own words. That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized 
                            that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
